# Global Visualization Dashboard
## Description
The dashboard features a 3D interactive globe you can rotate to view a selected statistic for each country. It pulls information from this 
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/countries-of-the-world-2023/data">Kaggle dataset</a>. You can drag to rotate the sphere and hover over a country to 
view the data for the selected feature. The dashboard also is visually interactive as the boxes representing each country are normalized in size to represent their relative amount
compared to the global maximum. This dashboard may be used to compare and analyze the countries of world based on a statistic of interest such as birth rate, GDP, etc.

## How It Works
The sphere animations and interactive nature of the dashboard was implemented using <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> 
and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>. Standard Javascript was used to interact with the HTML/CSS of the website.

## What I learned
I learned a lot about front-end development, particularly creating visually interactive websites. Three.js has so much more functionality and power to make awesome animations
than what I've used so far. The project also gave me a lot more Javascript experience.

## Future Goals
<ul>
  <li>Learn to make visually more appealing webpages!</li>
  <li>Explore more Three.js</li>
  <li>Other data visualization projects</li>
</ul>
